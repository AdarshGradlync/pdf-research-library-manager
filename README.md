# PDF Renamer

## Overview

PDF Renamer is a Python-based GUI application designed to automate the organization of academic literature.

The tool reads PDF metadata and first-page content to generate meaningful filenames, detects duplicate files using SHA256 hashing, copies renamed files to a destination folder, and creates an Excel log for tracking changes.
